#### Comments from Shahin ####
%%%%To be done till November 2, 2015%%%%%%%
Some abbreviations: @Tobi -> @T; @Sergey -> @S; @Matthias -> @M; @Shahin -> @Sh; @all -> all members
@all: where ever we've colors to choose: add some default colors and JColorChooser
@all: use JSlider for time intervals and give the time unit in ms. E.g. if you reduce the time the sleep() method should be increased. 
@T: please update GUI asap. 
@M: update the trajectory of the pendulums (better to have two options: fading and not fading)
@M: update NaSch rules and improve it.
@S: see tasks below ;)

Change GUI and add JMenuBar
- Add content to "Bifurcation" - new JFrame + JMenuBar
- Content of "Iterated maps" -> "Fix Point Calculator"
- "Iterated Maps" -> "Linear Iterated Maps" and "Nonlinear Iterated Maps" (for the content see the 
literature folder)
- "Lorenz Attractor" -> change the animation -  it is too slow and not clear.
- "DLA" -> to be adjusted
- "Oscillators" -> still need changes - drag&drop ...
- "Pendulums" -> Framesize ...
- "Deterministic Chaos" -> Not available?
- Add MLP to NN
